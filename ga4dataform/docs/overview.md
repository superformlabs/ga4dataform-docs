## Versions

### GA4Dataform Community (Open-source)
The open-source version of GA4Dataform will be available as a public repository on Github. This version contains the Dataform models without the ‘one-click’ installer app. The open-source version contains the same .sqlx and .js files as the ‘Core’ variant of GA4Dataform.

### GA4Dataform Core (Installer)
The installer version of GA4Dataform is a ‘one-click’ app that handles the complete installation of the package. This version is available in the Superform Labs store.
