### Install GA4Dataform

1. **Select Project and Data Set**: The installer will automatically list all Google Cloud Platform projects you have access to and, within each project, all available GA4 BigQuery export tables.

:::tip Multiple GA4 BigQuery Exports
If you have multiple BigQuery export projects, ensure you select the correct one. If you want to run GA4Dataform for each BigQuery Export you will have to run a different installation for each one of them. 
:::

2. **Installation Progress**: After clicking "Install GA4Dataform", the installer will display each setup step, such as checking APIs, creating the Dataform repository, and configuring permissions. Wait for each step to complete.

### Configure and Run GA4Dataform

Once the installation is complete, you'll see a success message and two optional next steps, shown as toggle buttons:
- The first option allows GA4Dataform to process your entire GA4 historical data set. It provides an estimate of the associated cost.
- The second option enables GA4Dataform to create a Dataform schedule to process your GA4 data daily.

Toggle on both options, then click "un GA4Dataform".

:::warning BigQuery Cost
Using GA4Dataform will incur BigQuery costs, so please monitor your billing. We're not responsible for any charges that may arise.
:::

:::tip Customization
Once installed, GA4Dataform is fully customizable. You can adjust the schedule workflow and modify variables to process your GA4 data differently (e.g., filtering by domains, events, etc.).
