## Browse to the files
On the repository page, select the created repository you just created, and browse to the Development workspace

![screenshot](images/Browse_files.png)

Browse to includes/custom_config.js and adjust the parameters to your needs

## Add some customisations
Now, you can configure custom parameters you want in your events dataset. Let’s look at GA4 and just use those:

![screenshot](images/custom_params.png)


We see 7 custom dimensions, of which 6 are needed
clean_path is already in the model (as page.path)
- 6 are going to be configured:
  - 5 as string
    - 1 as number (int)

I will rename the event param shop to become the column name shop_name

```

```

This website uses q as search term url parameter, and some other URL parameters to indicate filters. Let’s add those:

## Save your changes
When making changes, you have to test them (which we’re not going to do now, haha) and when it’s all working: push them into production.
First commit, then push
Commit

You've pushed successfully when the workspace is up to date and the green checkmark shows

## Run the model
Under "releases and scheduling", you can find the preconfigured "production" configuration.

Click start execution, and fill in the popup

Click "Start Execution" now.

## Check for success
Under "workflow execution logs" you can check if the model has ran succesfully
![screenshot](images/workflow_success.png)


In this case, there is an error! Click "VIEW DETAILS"

If we scroll down to row 629 we see that"ae-prijsfilter" is an invalid column name. Oops! We should have tested..
![screenshot](images/prijsfilter.png)


Back to the source. Let’s rename the column to prijsfilter

```
```

## Remember
commit
push

## Start new execution
Again
production
all tags
run with full refresh

## Check for success - part 2
Go to the workflow execution logs, and click REFRESH until you’re tired
If all check marks are green, the model ran successfully!

## Check Big Query
Go to Bigquery, and you should see the new tables.
Currently, the customisations are in the _outputs/ga4_events table in the schema under
![screenshot](images/bq_output.png)



## Connect Looker Studio to the sessions table
Open Looker Studio
Add data source, choose Big Query
Browse to the demo_daily_sessions_report table
Use session_date as date range dimension
