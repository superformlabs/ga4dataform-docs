GA4 Dataform Model Custom Configuration ("config.js")
  
  Here's a detailed explanation of the "config.js" file in the custom folder. This file allows users to customize various aspects of the GA4 Dataform model, focusing on parameters like event filtering, custom dimensions, and data validation checks.

  "config.js" - Custom Configuration File

  Purpose:
  This configuration file provides a way for users to customize the behavior of the GA4 Dataform model. Below are the sections and parameters that can be modified:

<details>
  <summary>GA4 Start Date</summary>
  ```
  GA4_START_DATE: "2020-01-01"
  ```
  <strong>Description</strong>: Defines the starting date for the GA4 data that the model should process.  
  <strong>Customization</strong>: Change this date to reflect the earliest data you want to include in your reports. For example, if you started collecting GA4 data on a different date, modify this to match that date.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Custom Event Parameters</summary>
  ```
  CUSTOM_EVENT_PARAMS_ARRAY: []
  ```
  <strong>Description</strong>: This allows you to specify custom event parameters that are not part of the standard GA4 data. The custom parameters will be added to the `event_params_custom` column.  
  <strong>Customization</strong>: Add parameters using the format `"{ name: "paramname", type: "TYPE", renameTo: "outputcolumnname" }"`.  
  <strong>Example:</strong>
  ```
  CUSTOM_EVENT_PARAMS_ARRAY: [
    { name: 'custom_param', type: 'string', renameTo: 'custom_output' },
    { name: 'n_items', type: 'int', description: 'The number of items in the shopping cart at the time of the event' }
  ]
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Custom Item Parameters</summary>
  ```
  CUSTOM_ITEM_PARAMS_ARRAY: []
  ```
  <strong>Description</strong>: Similar to event parameters, but for item custom dimensions and metrics. These will be stored in the `items.item_params_custom.*` column.  
  <strong>Customization</strong>: Add custom item parameters in the same format.  
  <strong>Example:</strong>
  ```
  CUSTOM_ITEM_PARAMS_ARRAY: [
    { name: "stock_status", type: "string" }
  ]
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Custom URL Parameters</summary>
  ```
  CUSTOM_URL_PARAMS_ARRAY: []
  ```
  <strong>Description</strong>: Allows you to extract custom URL parameters into their own columns.  
  <strong>Customization</strong>: Define custom URL parameters you want to extract in the format `"{ name: "param_name", cleaningMethod: method }"`. Note that url params will always be strings.
  <strong>Cleaning Methods</strong>: For now, the only cleaning method supported is `lowerSQL`. This will transform the string to lower case. Note: use `lowerSQL` without quotes.
  <strong>Example:</strong>
  ```
  CUSTOM_URL_PARAMS_ARRAY: [
    { name: "q", cleaningMethod: lowerSQL, description: "internal search engine term used - transformed to lowe case" },
    { name: "product-size", renameTo: "size" }
  ]
  ```
</details>

  <strong>Customization</strong>: Add event names you donâ€™t want to process.  
  <strong>Example:</strong> 
  ```

  ``` 
  <strong>Hostname Exclude/Include</strong>
  
  ```
